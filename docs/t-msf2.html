Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) denounces yet more bloodshed in Gaza, Palestine, as our teams continue to treat Palestinians who were critically wounded by Israeli airstrikes and quadcopters on 19 November, which have left dozens dead and scores more injured. Since Wednesday, our teams have treated both women and children with open fractures and gunshot wounds to their limbs and head. <br  />

While violence may not be new in the West Bank, Palestine, everything intensified after 7 October 2023. We’ve seen a sharp escalation: checkpoints, roadblocks, and incursions by the Israeli forces, and settlers have cut Palestinian towns and villages from each other. These restrictions are blocking Palestinians from being able to access basic services, such as healthcare, food markets, and schools.<br />

As an MSF psychologist working in Hebron, I can see and feel how people’s fear continues to increase. Fear is everywhere, and this time it is paralysing people. Palestinians aren’t just worried: they’re preparing themselves for loss.<br />
