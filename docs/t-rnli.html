Preventable deaths

            <p class="about">

Drowning is a silent epidemic that claims 300,000 lives every year*, many of them children. But this leading killer isn’t getting the global attention it deserves.

            </p>
            <p class="about">

The RNLI is working with global leaders, public health organisations and at-risk communities to help turn the tide. We want to make drowning prevention a priority worldwide and reduce this staggering loss of life.

            </p>
            <p class="about">

By raising awareness, conducting research and testing interventions, we can make a difference together.

Lifesaving interventions

Anyone can drown. No one should. We won’t stand by while anyone, anywhere, drowns. The RNLI’s international work is a small, but important, part of what we do.  


            </p>
            <p class="difference">


Working with our international partners and leaders, we’re helping communities most at risk of drowning with tailored, targeted interventions that will help stop these preventable deaths.
