Our vision        </h2>

At the Wikimedia Foundation we work towards the vision of a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.
            </p>
            <p class="difference">

We host a technology infrastructure that makes possible billions of visits to Wikipedia on a monthly basis. Since our founding in 2003, we have supported the hundreds of thousands of volunteer editors who edit, expand and curate the Wikimedia projects. We equip these volunteers with the most up-to-date tools, ensure connections to Wikipedia are fast, safe, and private, and develop new technology and products to meet the demands of our readers and editors.
            </p>
            <p class="difference">

We provide individuals and organizations around the world with funding to increase the knowledge on Wikipedia. We also undertake legal and advocacy efforts to protect people’s right to free knowledge.
