                The festive period is a time to celebrate and enjoy decorating trees, giving gifts and eating lots of delicious food.

                But all of this can have an impact on the environment. The additional waste from  Christmas is estimated to exceed 3 million tonnes in the UK.

                For example, of the 175 million mince pies purchased (using 175 tonnes of aluminium packaging), approximately 74 million are discarded.

                Of course, these activities are what makes Christmas special, but there are alternative approaches.

Wrapping Paper: In the UK alone, around 227,000 miles of wrapping paper are used each Christmas, with millions of rolls ending up in landfills because they contain plastic or glitter, which makes them non-recyclable.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
Christmas Cards: Roughly 1 billion Christmas cards are sold in the UK each year. If laid end to end, these cards could cover the distance between London and Sydney five times!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
Food Waste: Around 270,000 tons of food are wasted during Christmas in the UK, including 2 million turkeys and 74 million mince pies. That’s equivalent to filling over 6,000 double-decker buses!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
Gifts and Packaging: A large proportion of holiday gifts come in single-use plastic packaging. It’s estimated that 114,000 tons of plastic packaging will be thrown away in the UK alone over the holiday season.
