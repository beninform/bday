As an organisation, we are volunteer led and run, and do not have any full-time employees. We currently have around twenty volunteers who help to process requests, top phones up, manage our social media accounts and marketing, and liaise with agencies on the ground. Our team is made up of both refugees and supporters, and greatly benefits from the diversity in age, religion, gender, culture, and background of our volunteers.
