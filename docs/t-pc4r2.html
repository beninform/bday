                <p class="about">


Phone Credit for Refugees and Displaced People supports asylum seekers and refugees separated from their families by war and conflict. We provide mobile phone top-ups so that they can get in touch with their families, communicate with support agencies and stay safe.

                <p class="about">

We are a humanitarian response organisation set up by ordinary people – volunteers who give their time freely to help refugees feel safer. It is volunteer led and run, with no full-time employees. All money raised is used to provide phone credit, with a very small percentage going to provide outsourced infrastructure support.

            <p class="about">

Today, the group has almost 65,000 members, has completed almost 100,000 tops ups, and has raised over a million pounds. Our support has expanded to cover refugees across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

As an organisation, we are volunteer led and run, and do not have any full-time employees. We currently have around twenty volunteers who help to process requests, top phones up, manage our social media accounts and marketing, and liaise with agencies on the ground. Our team is made up of both refugees and supporters, and greatly benefits from the diversity in age, religion, gender, culture, and background of our volunteers.
